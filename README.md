# Tic_tac_toe_game


> This is a collaborative project to reproduce the Tic Tac Toe game in console with Ruby language.


## Game Instructions

### How do we play Tic Tac Toe?

- Players take turns playing
- 1st turn ‚Äî Player 1
- Player 1 places their token (X) in only 1 square of their choice
- 2nd turn ‚Äî Player 2
- Player 2 places their token (O) in only 1 square of their choice, except they can‚Äôt touch the square that Player 1‚Äôs token already fills
- 3rd turn- Player 1 ‚Ä¶. and the cycle continues until a player wins or there‚Äôs a tie game
- There are 8 winning combinations: Top row, Middle row, Bottom row, Left column, Middle column, Right column, Left diagonal, and Right diagonal
- There‚Äôs a draw/tie when the entire board is filled with X‚Äôs and O‚Äôs but no winning combinations can be found
